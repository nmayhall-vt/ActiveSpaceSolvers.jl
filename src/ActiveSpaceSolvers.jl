"""
This abstract type contains all the metadata that defines a CI basis
for example, if we subtype a `FCIProblem`, then this contains the metadata
to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the FCI basis.  
Diagonalization of H in a RASCI determinant basis would then be a different 
subtype.

Since a Problem essentially defines a Slater determinant basis, 
the combination of a `Problem`, and an `InCoreInts` can define the operator
acting on a trial state, which is a `LinearMap`. This type is then 
extended from the LinearMaps packages.

A `LinearMap` simply implements the action of our Hamiltnoian on a trial state 
defined by the `Problem`. By pairing this `LinearMap` with a `Solver` concrete
subtype, we can then generate our solution, which is a `CIStates{P,T}` type. 

A `Solution{P,T}` is then essentially a set of eigenstates for problem, `P`, of
datatype `T`. This can be used for constructed RDMs and operator matrices.
